# Design-of-Axial-and-Radial-Active-Magnetic-Bearing-for-High-Speed-Epoxy-Granite-Micromilling-Machine
This project addresses issues with current CNC micromilling machine bearings, limiting spindle speed to 20,000 rpm due to friction. Conventional bearings cause thermal complications and tool chatter, disrupting precision machining for tolerances under 5 micrometers. Axial and Radial Magnetic Bearings (AMB) aim to reduce friction.

The "Design and Development of Axial and Radial Magnetic Bearings for High-Speed Epoxy Granite Micromilling Machine" project is centered on providing an innovative alternative to conventional ball or roller bearings commonly employed in CNC micromilling machines. The current utilization of traditional bearings poses significant challenges, as the spindle is unable to reach its rated 20,000 rpm due to friction. This limitation not only leads to thermal complications within the system but also results in detrimental tool chatter. The repercussions of chatter are profound, disrupting the precision required for machining components with tighter tolerances, particularly in the 5-micrometer range.

To address these issues, the project proposes the integration of Axial and Radial Magnetic Bearings (AMB) as a groundbreaking solution. By introducing AMB, the objective is to alleviate friction between the bearing surface and the spindle, ultimately enabling the spindle to achieve higher RPMs without compromising performance. The reduction in friction has a dual benefit â€“ it diminishes chatter in the tool and mitigates the adverse effects of thermal expansion in the spindle system.

Key focus areas of the project encompass not only the reduction of friction but also the elimination of chatter, ensuring thermal stability within the system, and facilitating the achievement of tighter tolerances. The anticipated outcomes of this initiative include a marked improvement in overall machine performance, a significant reduction in thermal complications, and the elimination of tool chatter, thereby enhancing the precision and accuracy of the micromilling process. The implementation of AMB is poised to revolutionize CNC micromilling technology, offering a transformative approach to precision machining and laying the groundwork for future advancements in this critical field.
